A prequel to another game I made called Tumult. It is also my first time working with LibGDX so don't judge me.
I have always wanted to write a fighting game with good mechanics and this is a better attempt than my the original Tumult.
Though that does not matter much since it is not publicly available.
This game is supposed to be an RPG style game, similar to Pokemon with fighting game aspects.
It is in very early stages of developement so there is a lot missing and is unplayable in this stage.
There are many notes in my source code; I hope people find it inspiring. :)
